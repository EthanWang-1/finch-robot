## Development Checklist

| Completion  | Task |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Completed | - Connecting robot to computer; download necessary software to program the robot|
| Completed | - learning the finch library; start coding the robot to preform simple task  |
| Completed | - Start coding robot to match the task that it was maded to complete; test the code until it reach desire product |

## Design Cycle
I started out by breaking the code into more manageable pieces, such as telling the robot to go forward and stop when it reaches a wall. By breaking the code into more manageable parts, and testing each part individually, I am not only able to better understand how the robot works, but if an error or bug ever occurs, it's easier for me to fix. If the robot doesn't behave like it is supposed to, I retrace my code to see what mistakes occurred. If I am unable to locate the mistake, I will then attempt to put a print statement in my code, to see which part runs and the amount of time each part runs. I repeat this until the issue is solved. At the end, I will have multiple pieces of code that I was able to piece together to produce a final product. With a bit of tweaking and bug fixes for the final code, the code is finally completed, and the robot is able to run flawlessly. 

## Code to Highlight
```
if((int)Math.random()*2 == 1){
	f1.turn("R",90,10);
}else {
	f1.turn("R",90,10);
}
f1.stop();
```
## Questions
### What was your motivation?
My motivation for doing this project was to create one of the arcade games that we used to see in our childhood. However, unlike the arcane game found in the carnivals, my arcade games is able to move around, making it harder to toss in. I wanted to mix a part of my childhood with my own creation to create something new, so my motivation for creating this project was to reminiscence my past, but simultaneously incorporating my current knowledge. 
### What did you learn?
I learnt how to use a finch robot and java code to perform various tasks. Instead of looking at a digital product, we are able to see a more physical result. I am able to use methods in the Finch-robot library and use Tinkercad to 3D model my creation. 
### What makes your project stand out?
My robot incorporates rings that require the user to toss into the beams. I feel like this is unique to the other projects that are found in the classroom, as it is a game that requires the player to toss an object, rather than a stillless attachment to the robot.
